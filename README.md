Generate a User Persona with AI - requires an API key

This is currently being hosted on Streamlit here: 
https://userpersona-with-ai-demo.streamlit.app/

The code here is fairly basic- it uses openAI's chatGPT (3.5) to generate a User Persona based on a 1-liner idea for a project/product.

* You start by entering the 1-liner, and then the AI helps generate the PROBLEM description.
* You then enter the Target Customers and it will generate 3 variations of User Personas
* * You can start from scratch by re-entering a new 1-liner
* * Pressing the buttons will generate a new variation

 This code requires the use of an API key for openAI. You can then either paste the api directly into the code (line 15), or place it in the secrets.toml file, as I did here (there is no API key included).

 It should be pretty clear where improvements/changes can be made.

 If you have any questions, just ping me - though we'd prefer it if you tried our full web-app at iteraite.com
